         - old feature removed
         ! bug fixed

=========================================

0.0.9 -- 2002

+ sarp header now include timestamp to avoid replay attack
+ hosts are syncronized with the CA on startup
+ if the CA(s) are not respondig the daemon will shutdown
! fixed the time calculation for timing functions
! drop malformed packets


0.0.8 -- 20021007

+ sarp can now create keypair of different bit lenght
+ use DSA_sign_setup to precalculate DSA prameter (kinv and r)
+ LKM ported to kernel 2.2.x
! fixed a bug in the CA: loading ip addresses not belonging to any iface
! fixed : accept a reply KEY_NOTFOUND not signed

   basic setup (1024 bit keypair):
      + 3 host (2 peons and 1 CA)
      + ping from peon to peon (key not in cache) time=49.6 ms
      + ping from peon to peon (key in cache)     time=12.8 ms
   basic setup (512 bit keypair):
      + 3 host (2 peons and 1 CA)
      + ping from peon to peon (key not in cache) time=19.5 ms
      + ping from peon to peon (key in cache)     time=5.3 ms

 
0.0.7 -- 20021001

+ the CA is now complete
! fixed many memory leak
! fixed a bug in the LKM returning 0 if sarp was already loaded

   basic setup (1024 bit keypair):
      + 3 host (2 peons and 1 CA)
      + ping from peon to peon (key not in cache) time=220.3 ms
      + ping from peon to peon (key in cache)     time=22.4 ms
   basic setup (512 bit keypair):
      + 3 host (2 peons and 1 CA)
      + ping from peon to peon (key not in cache) time=34.1 ms
      + ping from peon to peon (key in cache)     time=8.8 ms


0.0.6 -- 20020925

+ added the 'sarp' command
   + keys generation
   + keys validation
+ dsa sign and verify
+ configuration file
+ CA list (one CA per interface)
+ store and retrive an host key


0.0.5 -- 20020914

+ the first REAL run was successful ;)
  (i've tried it without signatures, but it works! it correctly disable the 
   kernel, take the arp reply, look in known_host and add it to the neigh via
   socket netlink)
+ all the infrastructure is ready (now its time for criptography ;) )
   + neighbor management
   + sarp parsing
   + compatibility mode with arp reply


0.0.4 -- 20020903

+ libnetlink support (neighbor manipulation)
+ new configure for libs
! fixed a bug in the search_known_host logic


0.0.3 -- 20020901

+ libnet support (send_to_wire)
+ known_hosts hash table
+ preliminar ARP parsing (with reply)
+ --prefix to configuration files


0.0.2 -- 20020831

+ version 0.8 for sarp.o (lkm)
+ sarpd now listens on "any" iface


0.0.1 -- 20020829

+ moved the /proc/net/sarp entry in the more appropriate
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/sarp location
+ kernel patch ready
+ LKM code ready (without the automake file)


0.0.0 -- 20020826

* Here we go...

+ Makefiles and configure ready (with autoconf and automake)
+ directory structure
+ spec for rpm packaging
+ initial man page
